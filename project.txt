In the journey of growth,
 “The expert in anything was once a beginner.” No matter where we start,
 what truly matters is showing up every day with the will to learn.
As we face challenges, let’s remind ourselves that “Success is not
 final, failure is not fatal:
 It is the courage to continue that counts.” Each mistake carries a lesson; each setback fuels a stronger comeback.

Sometimes, progress feels slow, but “Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.” — a beautiful reminder that consistency beats intensity.

Keep in mind, “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.” Stay true to your path, follow your curiosity, and build something you're proud of.

Finally, no matter how far the goal may seem, “Believe you can, and you're halfway there.” Confidence and belief — these are the sparks that ignite every extraordinary story.

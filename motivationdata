Sometimes, progress feels slow, but “Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together.” — a beautiful reminder that consistency beats intensity.

Keep in mind, “Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life.” Stay true to your path, follow your curiosity, and build something you're proud of.

Finally, no matter how far the goal may seem, “Believe you can, and you're halfway there.” Confidence and belief — these are the sparks that ignite every extraordinary story.
